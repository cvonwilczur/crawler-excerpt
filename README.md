# crawler-excerpt
An excerpt from a workplace repo showcasing work on a Python script responsible for crawling portals. The overall crawler is capable of logging into and downloading from multiple portals that were specced out based on potential market value. The crawler is also capable of compiling hundreds of quotes into a single, bulk .csv for upload into our system.
